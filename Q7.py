# Create a School class  to handle classroom assignments:

# The constructor should create the following attributes: a list of classroom objects. See the description of the Room class in the next paragraph.
# A function called  assign_room(class_name, num_of_students) should look for available rooms and ensure that there is enough space for that number of students. If the class_name is already assigned with the classroom, change the number of students to reflect the new value. If no matching classroom can be found, the relevant error message should be displayed.
# A function called print_assigned_room() is used to print a list of assigned classrooms, containing details like room number and capacity. class_name and the number of students enrolled.
# A function called unassign_room(room_id) that removes the room assignment by resetting the target room objectâ€™s attributes related to the assignment. The function will free up the room so that a new class can be assigned to it.
# Create a Room class that has the following attributes:

# Room id, assigned (boolean), and room capacity, which indicates the maximum number of students that can fit in that room, the class_name, as well as the number of students who are currently enrolled in that class.
# Create a main function to test all the functionalties of your classes.
